## Abstract
Increased dopamine (DA) signaling in the striatum has been a cornerstone
hypothesis about psychosis for over 50 years. Increased dopamine release results
in psychotic symptoms, while D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) antagonists are
antipsychotic. Recent schizophrenia GWAS identified risk-associated common
variants near the DRD2 gene, but the risk mechanism has been unclear. To gain
novel insight into risk mechanisms underlying schizophrenia, we performed a
comprehensive analysis of the genetic and transcriptional landscape of
schizophrenia in postmortem caudate nucleus from a cohort of 443 individuals.
Integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis, transcriptome
wide association study (TWAS), and differential expression analysis, we found
many new genes associated with schizophrenia through genetic modulation of gene
expression. Using a new approach based on deep neural networks, we construct
caudate nucleus gene expression networks that highlight interactions involving
schizophrenia risk. Interestingly, we found that genetic risk for schizophrenia
is potentially associated with decreased expression of the short isoform of
DRD2, which encodes the presynaptic autoreceptor, and not with the long isoform,
which encodes the postsynaptic receptor. This association suggests that
decreased control of presynaptic DA release is a potential genetic mechanism of
schizophrenia risk. Altogether, these analyses provide a new resource for the
study of schizophrenia that can bring insight into risk mechanisms and potential
novel therapeutic targets.
