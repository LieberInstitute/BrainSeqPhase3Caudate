## Abstract
Recent studies of gene expression in the human brain have provided biological
insights about the genetic origins of psychiatric disorders, such as
schizophrenia. Most of these studies, however, have focused exclusively on
cortical regions though subcortical nuclei, such as striatum, have figured
prominently in the circuitry implicated in schizophrenia and its dense
dopaminergic innervation is targeted by current antipsychotic drugs. To gain
novel insight into risk mechanisms underlying schizophrenia, we performed a
comprehensive analysis of the genetic and transcriptional landscape of
schizophrenia in the postmortem caudate nucleus of 443 individuals. Integrating
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) analysis, Mendelian Randomization
with the latest schizophrenia GWAS, transcriptome wide association study (TWAS),
and differential expression analysis, we identified many new genes associated
with schizophrenia risk including possibly the dopamine D2 receptor short
isoform. We examined the effect of antipsychotics in the caudate and show
extensive influence on gene expression. Using a new approach based on deep
neural networks, we construct caudate nucleus gene expression networks that
highlight interactions involving schizophrenia risk. Altogether, these analyses
provide a new resource for the study of schizophrenia that can bring insight
into risk mechanisms and potential novel therapeutic targets.
